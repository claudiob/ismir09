      <h1>Mining the Social Web for Music-Related Data</h1>
      <h2>A Hands-On Tutorial</h2>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>This page presents the tutorial by Claudio Baccigalupo and Benjamin Fields that will take place in Kobe (Japan) on October 26th, 2009 as part of the 10th <a href="">ISMIR conference</a>.</p>

      <h3>Material</h3>
      <p>The tutorial will show how to write working pieces of code for relevant music research applications. Participants should bring their own laptops to follow the demonstrations and the examples in real time. All the source code that will be written in the tutorial is included in the package <a href="">sources.zip</a> that every participants is invited to download. In addition, the slides that will be used during the tutorial are available in a separate package <a href="">slides.pdf</a>.</p>

      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <p>The examples of the tutorial make use of multiple programming languages and libraries. All the software required can be obtained for free from the Internet, as explained hereafter.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Python <em>(examples 1, 3, 5)</em></dt>
        <dd>
          This programming language is pre-installed in many Unix systems, including OS X. To test the presence of Python on a computer, open a Terminal console and type:
          <pre><span class="shell">shell&gt;</span> python --version</pre>
          If the command returns an error, then Python is not installed. In this case, download and install Python following the instructions at <a href="">python.org</a>.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      
      <h3>About the tutorial</h3>
      <p>The social web is a useful resource for those conducting research in music informatics. Yet there exists no &ldquo;standard&rdquo; way to integrate web-based data with more common signal-based music informatics methods.<br />
         This tutorial goes through the entire process of retrieving and leveraging data from the social web for MIR tasks. This is done through the use of hands-on examples intended to introduce the larger ISMIR community to web-mining techniques.<br /> 
         Different examples show how to automatically retrieve from the web genre-labelled audio excerpts, lyrics, social data, acoustic analyses and similarity measures for millions of songs.</p>
         
      <h3>About the authors</h3>
      <p>Claudio Baccigalupo is a PhD candidate with the <a href="">Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (IIIA-CSIC)</a> in Barcelona (Spain) with the thesis discussion expected in November 2009.<br />
        Benjamin Fields is a PhD candidate with the <a href="http://doc.gold.ac.uk/isms/">Intelligent Sound and Music Systems (ISMS)</a> research group at the Department of Computing, Goldsmiths, University of London (United Kingdom) with his dissertation submission anticipated in late spring 2010.</p>
