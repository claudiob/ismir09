			<p>Claudio Baccigalupo (b. 1979) is a PhD candidate at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (IIIA-CSIC), with the thesis discussion expected in Spring 2009.  He holds a 5-year degree in Computer Technology with top marks and distinction.  His research focuses on recommender systems in a musical context: he investigated how to extract musical knowledge from the analysis of playlists, how to apply Case Based Reasoning for recommending playlists,  how to obtain a group-customised musical selection in a web radio with multiple listeners,  and how to exploit social behaviour data to improve the description and understanding of songs and videos, combining several different A.I. techniques.  His most recent works were presented at conferences such as ISMIR 2008, ECML 2007, ICMC 2007, and ICCBR 2007, where he was granted the ‘Best Application Paper Award’. His research has involved data mining and analysis of different web-based music communities, such as <a href="http://www.mystrands.com">MusicStrands</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm</a>, <a href="http://www.yes.com">Yes.com</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com"> MySpace</a>.
			<p><a href="http://benfields.net">Benjamin Fields</a> (b.1981) is a PhD candidate with the <a href="http://doc.gold.ac.uk/isms/">Intelligent Sound and Music Systems (ISMS)</a> research group at the Department of Computing, Goldsmiths, University of London, with his dissertation submission anticipated in late spring 2010.  In 2004 he completed the Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering with Honours in the Major from the University of California, Santa Cruz.  In 2006 he completed the Master's of Science in Music Engineering Technology from the University of Miami, with a thesis investigating the efficacy of using multiple statistical models to produce more accurate classification of music by genre.  His current research centres on applications to understand and reduce the semantic gap between the social relationships of artists and the acoustic similarity of works these artists produce.  In particular this is done by mining both audio and social data from \href <a href="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace</a> and using this data to construct cross-modal recommendation systems.  Recent works have been presented at ISMIR 2008, ICMC 2008, AES 123 and AES 124.  He is the co-developer and administrator  of <a href="http://mypyspace.sourceforge.net">MyPySpace</a>, an open source project to mine social and audio data from MySpace in an effort to make the social network more machine readable and accessible to the open data community.  He also recommends music the traditional way, hosting the weekly program <i>Speaker Damage Radio!</i> on <a href="http://www.wiredradio.co.uk">Wired</a>, Goldsmiths student radio.
