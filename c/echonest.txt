The third example is for people working on music and mood.

Say that you have a data set of songs that, according to your laboratory experiments, have been associated with different moods: happy, sad, et cetera.

What you would like to discover is whether this mood can be statistically associated with specific acoustic features of the songs. You have certain hypotheses, for instance that songs are described as "sad" when their main mode is minor (rather than major), or songs are described as "joyful" when their average tempo is over 140 BPM.

However, you do not have the tools to extract this acoustic-related features from these songs: you would need to find some programmes that does this for yourself, or code a new acoustic analyser just for this purpose. Once again, the Internet and music-related API can come to a hand.

In this example, we do not use the Internet as a source of *data* (as in the first example, where we retrieved genre-labelled songs). Instead, we use the Internet as a source of *analysis tools*. In particular, we ask a Web service to analyse the audio content of our songs and to return their evaluation in terms of mode and tempo.

For this purpose, we will use The Echo Nest. The Echo Nest has a Web API that takes an audio file in input and returns a detailed description of that audio, in terms of bars, beats, duration, key, loudness, mode, tempo, et cetera.

I have prepared a python script called mood_evaluation.py that submits to the Echo Nest API two audio files that are indicative of a "happy" and a "sad" mood. The Echo Nest analyses this two files and returns their mode (major/minor) and tempo.

In order to run this script, the pyechonest has to be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/pyechonest/ and installed calling:
$ wget http://pyechonest.googlecode.com/files/pyechonest-0.1a.zip
$ unzip pyechonest-0.1a.zip 
$ cd pyechonest
$ sudo python setup.py install
$ cd ..
$ sudo rm -rf pyecho*

Note: This example is incomplete. It has to be expanded to include more audio files that have been tagged as "sad", "happy", et cetera.
Then some hypotheses have to be done, for instance saying that the "sad" mood can be associated with the "minor" mode.
Then the Echo Nest analysis should be used to verify these hypotheses
