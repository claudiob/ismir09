This project lists snippets of code that will be used during the tutorial in the ISMIR 2009 conference to illustrate how the Internet can be mined for music-related data and algorithms.

Each folder contains a different example (e.g., how to retrieve lyrics, how to obtain genre-labelled songs). 
Please refer to the README file in every folder for more details.
